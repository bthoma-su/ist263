<body>Benjamin Thomas
I'm an Art Photography major at VPA, specializing in food and sports photography.
I run a professional photography business back home and have shot for numerous athletes and teams. Here at Syracuse, I shoot for Syracuse Athletics.
When I'm not behind the camera, I play baseball, game pretty often, and my favorite things to watch are One Piece or Waves.
